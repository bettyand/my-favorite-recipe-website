    <h1>Spinach Pie Directions</h1>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350F/175C</li>
      <li>
        Defrost and drain the spinach. <em>You don't want it to be too wet!</em>
      </li>
      <li>Beat eggs in a bowl, then stir in crumbled feta.</li>
      <li>
        Sautee garlic and onion in olive oil in your cast iron skillet on medium
        to medium-high heat until softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the spinach, black pepper, and dill. Continue sauteeing to combine
        and start cooking the spinach. 
      <li>
        Remove from heat or just turn off the
        burner to avoid cooking the eggs too fast.
      </li>
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the egg and feta mixture and fold it into the spinach mixture to
        combine, then smooth it out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open the crescent rolls and unroll the sheet of dough, then place on top to form a
        crust. You may need to trim or piece together the dough to cover
        completely.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Optional: Brush the top with olive oil.</i>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the crust is nicely browned. The filling should be fully cooked, but if you like you can use a food thermometer to make sure it's at 165F for egg safety.</li>
      <li>Let cool for a few minutes to finish setting, then cut and serve!</li>
    </ol>
