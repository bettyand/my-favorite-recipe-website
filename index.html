    <h1>Spinach Pie</h1>
    <p>This is the first recipe I came up with myself. I used to work across the street from the NC Legislative Building, and would go to their cafeteria for lunch on my breaks. They served spinach pie on Tuesdays and I liked it a lot, but I wasn't always scheduled that day of the week. I decided to learn to make it myself, so I looked up some spanakopita recipes. Working with phillo dough sounded hard, and I hate doing dishes, so I developed and tested my own easy, one-pan version.</p>
