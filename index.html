    <h1>Spinach Pie</h1>

    <!-- used strong/em instead of b/i for better accessibility -->
    <p>
      This is the first recipe I came up with myself. I used to work across the
      street from the NC Legislative Building, and would go to their cafeteria
      for lunch on my breaks. They served
      <span style="color: darkgreen"><strong>spinach pie</strong></span> on Tuesdays and I liked it a
      lot, but I wasn't always scheduled that day of the week. <br />
      <br />
      I decided to learn to make it myself, so I looked up some spanakopita
      recipes as a starting point. Working with phillo dough sounded hard, and I
      hate doing dishes, so I developed and tested my own
      <strong>easy, one-pan version</strong>.<br />
      <br />
      I've made this dish many times since, and it's one of my family's
      <em>favorite meals!</em> Since it has eggs and cheese as well as
      vegetables, you can eat it alone or add some side dishes. I recommend
      bacon and fruit salad for a nice brunch.
